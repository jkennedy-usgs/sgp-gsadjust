# GSadjust
GSadjust is a cross-platform graphical interface for processing relative gravity surveys. It provides an interface for data selection, drift evaluation and correction, network adjustment, and integrating data from modern relative (Scintrex, ZLS) and absolute (Micro-g Lacoste) gravity meters. This software is a product of the USGS Southwest Gravity Program (http://go.usa.gov/xqBnQ).
