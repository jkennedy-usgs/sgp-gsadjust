**This is the development branch of GSadjust. Code in this repository has not necessarily been reviewed by USGS.**

**The approved preliminary software release is at** [https://github.com/usgs/sgp-gsadjust](https://github.com/usgs/sgp-gsadjust "USGS GSadjust repo")

# GSadjust
GSadjust is a cross-platform graphical interface for processing relative gravity surveys. It provides an interface for data selection, drift evaluation and correction, network adjustment, and integrating data from modern relative (Scintrex, ZLS) and absolute (Micro-g Lacoste) gravity meters. This software is a product of the USGS Southwest Gravity Program (http://go.usa.gov/xqBnQ).

GSadjust is public-domain software written for Python 3.5 and the PyQt5 framework. Although basic functionality has been tested on Mac and Linux machines, there may be unknown issues on those operating systems. 

Bug reports by email (jkennedy@usgs.gov) or by submitting an issue through GitHub are welcome. 

**Online help is available at [https://jkennedy-usgs.github.io/sgp-gsadjust/](https://jkennedy-usgs.github.io/sgp-gsadjust/)**

**Installing GSadjust**
Windows: Download the [.zip](https://github.com/jkennedy-usgs/sgp-gsadjust/releases/tag/v0.99) and unzip to the folder of your choice, then launch the GSadjust shortcut.

## Data selection interface
* Select/deselect samples and stations
* Plot gravity, earth tide correction, tilt, etc.
* Imports both Scintrex and Burris data formats

## Drift correction
* Allows for Roman (1946) method, continuous drift correction (Kennedy and Ferre, 2016, doi: 10.1093/gji/ggv493), or determined from least-squares solution
* Graphical interface shows drift rate vs. time

## Network adjustment
* Individual delta-g's can be enabled/diabled
* Uses numpy or Gravnet (Hwang and others, 2002) for network adjustment
* Import absolute-gravity data directly from .project.txt files
* Adjustment diagnostics: residual histogram, measured vs. adjusted, etc.

## Gravity change
* Calculates gravity change between series
* Shows time-series plot of gravity change at all stations
* Shows map view with user-selectable base map

For convenience GSadjust is distributed with a Windows executable for Gravnet software (Hwang and others, 2002; not to be confused with Gravnet software used by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency). USGS assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the network-adjustment results generated by Gravnet.
