**This is the development branch of GSadjust. Code in this repository has not necessarily been reviewed by USGS.**

# GSadjust
GSadjust is a cross-platform graphical interface for processing relative gravity surveys. It provides an interface for data selection, drift evaluation and correction, network adjustment, and integrating data from modern relative (Scintrex, ZLS) and absolute (Micro-g Lacoste) gravity meters. This software is a product of the USGS Southwest Gravity Program (http://go.usa.gov/xqBnQ).

GSadjust is public-domain software written for Python 3.5 and the PyQt5 framework. Although basic functionality has been tested on Mac and Linux machines, there may be unknown issues on those operating systems. 

Bug reports by email (jkennedy@usgs.gov) or by submitting an issue through GitHub are welcome. 

**Online help is available at [https://jkennedy-usgs.github.io/sgp-gsadjust/](https://jkennedy-usgs.github.io/sgp-gsadjust/)**

**Installing GSadjust**

The easiest, most reliable way to install GSadjust is using Conda to create a custom Python environment:

1. Download and install the appropriate Miniconda installer for your platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, 32 or (probably) 64-bit):
[https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html "Miniconda download"). Any Python version (e.g., 2.7 or 3.6) is okay. When installing on Windows, select the "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" option, or, in step 3, launch the command window by choosing "Anaconda (64-bit)" from the Windows Start Menu. Alternatively, the Miniconda executables (i.e., conda.exe) can be manually added to the Windows path.

2. Download the GSadjust repository as a zip file using the green "Clone or download" button near the top of this page. Unzip the directory in a location of your choice.

3. Open a command window or terminal in the new directory (sgp-gsadjust or sgp-gsadjust-master) and create a new conda environment:

    ```
    conda env create --file environment.yml
    ```

    This creates a new conda environment named py35 with the appropriate python modules. 
    
    Alternatively, install Python 3.5+ directly and/or in a different virtual environment. The following packages are required:
    
    ```
    matplotlib numpy pyqt=5 scipy networkx

    ```
    
4a. If Miniconda (conda.exe) is installed on your path, double-click gsadjust.bat to launch GSadjust.

4b. If Miniconda is _not_ on your path, open the Anaconda command window (or re-use the command window from step 3), navigate to the sgp-gsadjust-master directory, and type:

    ```
    activate py35
    python gsadjust\gsadjust.py
    ```

## Data selection interface
* Select/deselect samples and stations
* Plot gravity, earth tide correction, tilt, etc.
* Imports both Scintrex and Burris data formats

## Drift correction
* Allows for Roman (1946) method, continuous drift correction (Kennedy and Ferre, 2016, doi: 10.1093/gji/ggv493), or determined from least-squares solution
* Graphical interface shows drift rate vs. time

## Network adjustment
* Individual delta-g's can be enabled/diabled
* Uses numpy or Gravnet (Hwang and others, 2002) for network adjustment
* Import absolute-gravity data directly from .project.txt files
* Adjustment diagnostics: residual histogram, measured vs. adjusted, etc.

For convenience GSadjust is distributed with a Windows executable for Gravnet software (Hwang and others, 2002; not to be confused with Gravnet software used by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency). USGS assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the network-adjustment results generated by Gravnet.
