    Deltas are calculated when one of the "populate delta table" menu commands
    is chosen. They may or may not be drift-corrected. Before a network
    adjustment is done, there is no residual and the default value of -999 is
    assigned.

    Three types of deltas implemented as subclasses.
    DeltaNormal ('normal'): calculated between two stations (g2 - g1)
    Delta3Point ('three_point'): calculated between one station, and an interpolated value
        betweeen two stations (Roman method).  self.station2 is a tuple with two
        stations, self.station1 is a single station.
    DeltaList ('list'): a delta is calculated from a list of deltas. Used with the Roman
        method to average three-point deltas. self.station2 is a list.
        self.station1 is None.

    3 standard deviation values are relevant:
    1) sd: from the drift correction method. This value is always shown on the Drift tab
    2) adj_sd: from a combination of the drift correction sd value and the options set under
        adjustment options (e.g., additive and multiplicative factors)
    3) assigned_sd: assigned by the user

    Either (2) or (3) is used in the network adjustment (i.e., shown on the Network
    Adjustment tab). If (3) is assigned, it overrides the value set by (2).

    (1) is a property; (2) and (3) are attributes, although 2 could also possibly be
    a property.
